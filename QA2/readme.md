# Goal #
> Choose one of the six problems discussed in classroom for unit 2 and write codes to confirm it.

# Scope: one of the six items #
1. PCA for dimensionality reduction
2. Rough set for feature selection
3. Haar Wavelets for feature creation
4. Discretization without class labels
5. KNN search based on proximity matrix
6. Similarity measures: cosine, extended Jaccard, correlation

# Requirements #
- For your chosen item, write the codes *by yourself* together with your explanation as the comments.
- In addition to the sample data used in the problems, prepare *another set of data* to verify your program
- The package or utility you use to solve the problem cannot be a duplicate of the others (according to the timestamp of first commit).

# Steps #
0. If you have ever forked this repository before, you MUST delete the entire forked repositoty and then fork the current version.
1. With your GitHub account and the *forked* repository, i.e., /yourAccount/Introduction-to-data-mining/.
2. In the folder /Introduction-to-data-mining/QA2/, create a folder named by *studentID*, e.g., /10812345/.
3. In the folder /Introduction-to-data-mining/QA2/*studentID*/, create *a single file* to keep your codes and then commit. 
4. With your GitHub account, create a *Pull Request* to ask me whether your folder can be merged into my repository.
5. After I merge it, check the existence of your folder: "felixwuyh.github.io/Introduction-to-data-mining/QA2/*studentID*/*fileName*".
